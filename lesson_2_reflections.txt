What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

when we initialize a repo i think the git structure with the git required files is created. 
we require to do it to enable git to start tracking changes in the files in the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area consists of a subset of files in the working directory which the user feels are required to be committed.
I think it enables us to choose between files which we want to commit and not end up committing all files irrespective of changes.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

by adding files with changes and then commiting them individually

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

branches will be helpful; in cases where we want both to save the work we have done and explore a different technique that might have the potential to both
disrupt or improve the work. so we would need to get back if the different technique is not going to work.
