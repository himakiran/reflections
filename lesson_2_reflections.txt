What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

when we initialize a repo i think the git structure with the git required files is created. 
we require to do it to enable git to start tracking changes in the files in the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area consists of a subset of files in the working directory which the user feels are required to be committed.
I think it enables us to choose between files which we want to commit and not end up committing all files irrespective of changes.
