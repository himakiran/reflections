When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when we work from different client devices and many people have to work on a single project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might not always want to pull changes especially when multiple people are working on the project. somtimes you wish to pull changes only after you have completed
finishing part of your project,

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
 forks are when we duplicate repositories from one github account to another. clones are when we duplicate a repo from github to a pc or from one pc folder to another.
 branch is when we dont fully clone the repo on a pc but split the repo after the last commit into two branches one being the existing which we call the master branch
 and one the additional branch where we would like to work on a additional feature or so and keep those commits in that branch
 
 What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
it shows you subsequently how many local commits have happened and how much the remote is lagging behind. it also aids in helping you to know that you are ahead of the remote
by prompting you to push the changes to the remote. By having the last known state of the remote stored locally it shall also know exactly how many commits to push
to remote.
