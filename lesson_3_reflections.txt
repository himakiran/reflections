When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when we work from different client devices and many people have to work on a single project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might not always want to pull changes especially when multiple people are working on the project. somtimes you wish to pull changes only after you have completed
finishing part of your project,
